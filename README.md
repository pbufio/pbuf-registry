# Free-Forever Open-Source Protobuf Registry

![Status](https://github.com/pbufio/pbuf-registry/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

The registry provides a central place to store and manage your protobuf files.

## Motivation

The protobuf files are usually stored in the same repository as the code that uses them. 
This approach works well for small projects, but it becomes a problem when you have multiple repositories that use the same protobuf files. 
In this case, you have to copy manually the files to each repository, which is not only tedious but also error-prone.

The registry solves this problem by providing a central place to store and manage your protobuf files and sync the files with your repositories.
